      label.}
  - {tweak: Can now use destination taggers on wrapped mobs and ship them through
      disposals.}
  - {tweak: Damage applied to wrapped mobs now applies to the underlying mob. Wrapped
      mobs/packages are destructible.}
  - {bugfix: Fixed oversight where punching a structure led to the attack happening
      twice.}
