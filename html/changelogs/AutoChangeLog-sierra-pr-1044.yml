changes:
  - tweak: Bruise kits no longer patch up external damage on mobs placed on optables
      if on help intent. Need to switch to non-help intent. This is to prevent accidental
      closures during surgeries. This does not apply to ghetto surgeries.
  - bugfix: Fixes welders and nano-paste not working during surgeries.
  - bugfix: Fixes coins not working in ghetto robotic surgeries.
  - bugfix: Fixes being unable to drink from glass bottles.
