  - balance: Self-recharging guns such as the Advanced Energy Gun and energy based
      borg and mech weapons now delay recharging when they are fired. This is to prevent
      guns from self-charging in the middle of mag-dumping the gun and force more
      tactical consideration of when to fall back to "recharge" the weapon.
