  - {rscadd: 'Legion mobs can now be "recalled" by the legion, either to another location
      or off the map entirely. This process is currently only triggered manually by
      admins.'}
  - {admin: Added "Legion Mass Recall" verb to the "Special Verbs" section that runs
      the recall process on all mobs in the global legion list that are on a given
      z-level and its connections.}
  - {admin: Added `legion_recall_me()` proc that can be manually called on a mob to
      have it perform a legion recall.}
