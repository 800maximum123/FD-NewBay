  - {tweak: Shards have different crossing sounds.}
  - {tweak: Crossing shards hurts simple mobs.}
  - {tweak: Crossing shards damages bare robotic and crystal organs.}
  - {tweak: 'If prone, shards can hurt any part of the body. Thick clothing protects
      against this.'}
  - {tweak: 'If a shard hurts a meaty organ, it can embed. Different shard types have
      their own probability.'}
  - {tweak: Shard damage is based on force instead of fixed.}
  - {rscadd: 'Added caltrops. Caltrops are uplink-buyable shards that come in packs
      of 4 and pierce many types of shoe. Only magboots, regular (not toeless) workboots,
      combat boots, and antagonist galoshes protect against them.'}
  - {rscadd: "Added thumbtacks in small containers next to every noticeboard. Thumbtacks
      are an offense against goodness that respect shoes and thick clothing but always
      embed and don't weaken, allowing the unwary to collect quite a few if moving
      unprotected."}
