changes:
  - rscadd: Adds xenofauna carbines, which are effective against simplemobs but not
      humanoids. Sec-Arm gets two by default, and more can be ordered. They can be
      emagged, which changes their beam to that of a compact smartgun lethal beam.
  - tweak: Supply packs for ammo have had their costs reduced and delivered items
      increased to make ordering ammo a competitive option, but they also require
      appropriate access to open beyond just normal security access. Sec SMGs can
      now be ordered on code blue.
  - tweak: Meatstation guards now use already emagged xenofauna carbines, increasing
      their lethality *significantly*. Their potential spawns have been reduced to
      account for this.
