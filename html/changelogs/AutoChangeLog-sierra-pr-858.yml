changes:
  - tweak: The crew manifest displayed to observers and ghosts now uses the IC manifest,
      reflecting the state of the `Status` field as displayed to people in game.
  - tweak: The OOC manifest (The one displayed in the player lobby) now hides the
      Activity column, masking the life and activity status of crew entries.
  - tweak: Crew manifest entries for crew members listed as `Stored` do not appear
      on the OOC manifest.
