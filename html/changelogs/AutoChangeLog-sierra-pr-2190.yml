      containers from Aurora. Updates several unique Bay sprites to the same standard.'}

      If shaken, fizzy drinks explode when opened.'}

      experienced cooking skill for a 100% success chance.}

      by growing almonds). Added these to several food items and a new protein bar
      flavor, "peanut crunch".'}

      new food and drink recipes that use them (ported from Aurora, PBJ sprite from
      tg).'}
  - {rscadd: Adds recipes for sprinkles and white wine.}
  - {tweak: Vacuum flasks have caps now. You can take them off and use them as cups.}

  - {tweak: 'Coffee cups (the ones from vending machines), cup ramen (resprited),
      paper water cups, and condiment containers (the generic ones) show the color
      of their contents. Tweaked some reagent colors to look nicer in cups.'}
  - {tweak: 'Soda bottles are now small bottles to match their new sprites, doubled
      the amount of soda bottles in the booze-o-mat to compensate.'}
