changes:
  - tweak: The threshhold for the cryo interface displaying a temperature n warning
      (orange) colors adjusted to 170, matching the effective temperature limit of
      cryoxadone and clonexadone.
  - imageadd: Cryo tubes now have color-coded lights, indicating power status and
      temperature status. Blue = powered but turned off. Green = powered and safe.
      Yellow/orange = powered and above 170. Red = powered and above 237K (0C). No
      light = Unpowered.
  - imageadd: Cryo tube lights are now emmissive.
