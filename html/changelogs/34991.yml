changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds 14 new festive food recipes."
  - rscadd: "Adds space spice, a general use spice condiment. Can be found in kitchen cabinets near you."
  - tweak: "Tofurkey uses a new sprite, can be sliced like roast chicken, and has had its recipe changed (4 tofu, 1 stuffing)."
  - tweak: "Bread recipe has been changed from 2 dough + 1 egg to just 2 dough (so bread, in theory, can be skrell-safe)."
  - tweak: "Potatoes, onions, and garlic are less juicy and have less sad-tasting juice."
  - tweak: "Minor changes: Updates sprites on several food items. Adds filling colors to some food items that were missing them. Milosoup is now miso soup."
