changes:
  - tweak: Fireaxe cabinets now use standardized health. Minimum damage threshold
      is set to 15 (Matching the previous force requirement to break the cabinet),
      and maximum health is set to 30.
  - rscadd: Fireaxe cabinets can now be repaired using reinforced glass. A fully broken
      fireaxe cabinet will still be open and unlocked once repaired. The cost is 1
      sheet regardless of damage - You're replacing the entire glass pane.
