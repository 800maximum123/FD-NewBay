changes:
  - rscadd: Adds challenge coins in the traitor uplink. They unlock a secret compartment
      containing uplink items in any vendor on the ship. Item costs 50 TCs; comes
      with 5 coins making each worth 10 TCs.
  - tweak: Each compartment has an average worth of 16 TCs. They are usually related
      to the theme of the vendor. Higher cost items are not guaranteed to spawn, meaning
      you may get less TCs than your coin is worth. Or much more, depending on your
      luck.
  - tweak: Using a challenge coin or an emag on a vending machine makes it scream
      anti-Sol slogans for the benefit of all nearby non-traitors.
  - bugfix: Makes vending machine icons turn back on after being anchored in a powered
      area.
