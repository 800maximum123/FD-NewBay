changes:
  - bugfix: Zombies can now attack borgs and mechs, which were previously invulnerable
      to them.
  - bugfix: Mobs now drop any handheld items after zombifying.
  - bugfix: Zombies can once again destroy doors, shutters, and unreinforced walls
      -- albeit very slowly.
  - tweak: Zombie NPCs are better at prioritizing prey, and will defend themselves
      against non-human mobs.
  - balance: Nerfs the pain damage of zombie attacks, reducing their ability to incapacitate.
