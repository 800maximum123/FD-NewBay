changes:
  - tweak: Melee weapon cooldown has been tweaked to be less spammy.
  - bugfix: You are now able to examine/jointlock/dislocate/and pin other mobs using
      grabs, depending on intent.
  - tweak: Grabs now leave fingerprints on uncovered body parts. If covered, chance
      of prints/fibers on clothing as previous behavior.
