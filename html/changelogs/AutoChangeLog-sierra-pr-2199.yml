changes:
  - {soundadd: Adds a minigun sound to the mounted and handheld miniguns. The sound
      is "Vulcan Machine Gun Series" from the YouTube Sound Library and part of Creative
      Commons (CC BY 4.0). Edited by me in Audacity to be a looping 0.5 second .ogg
      file.}
  - {tweak: Applies the gunshot_smg sound effect to the sec_smg.}
  - {tweak: Hivebots have had projectilesound added to some entries as the projectiles
      they were using no longer have their own sounds.}
  - {tweak: Moves most ballistic weapon sounds to the guns instead of them being weapon
      specific.}
  - {bugfix: Adds a missing neckbrace to the GCC operative hardsuit that now shows
      when active.}
