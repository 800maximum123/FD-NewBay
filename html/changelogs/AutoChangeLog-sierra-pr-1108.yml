changes:
  - bugfix: Borg antag items that recharge (guns, various reagent items) now recharge
      properly,  Borg modules that used the drone space cleaner without ever recharging
      it now recharge it, and Surgeon borgs recharge their sterilizine. All rechargable
      borg antag items recharge at a more reasonable speed.
  - bugfix: Borg item icons now update when recharging, making it less of a guessing
      game for if your tools are charged.
  - tweak: Flamethrowers and syringe guns both now give feedback on their ammo and
      ready status when examined. Flamethrowers require fuel to ignite, and go out
      when they run out of fuel.
