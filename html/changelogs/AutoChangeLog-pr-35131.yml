changes:
  - {bugfix: The Sol operative suit shield now has a 10 second cooldown before you
      can turn it back on after it dies.}
  - {tweak: The shield now takes 1000kw to fill instead of 500kw. It takes the same
      amount of time but will drain your suit cell more than before now.}
delete-after: true
