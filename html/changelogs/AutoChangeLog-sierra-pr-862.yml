changes:
  - tweak: Can now stab eyes with all tiny, small, and normal sized sharp items.
  - tweak: It is now possible to damage glass/mask items if eye-stabbing with sufficient
      force. This is affected by CQC skill, making it easier to break glasses with
      higher skill. It is not possible to break hats that cover eyes (e.g riot helmets)
      in this way however, no matter the force.
  - tweak: It is now possible to miss while trying to stab someone's eyes.
